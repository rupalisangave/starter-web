Bhatt established herself in Bollywood with her three film releases of 2014.[18][19] She played the protagonist of Imtiaz Ali's road film Highway opposite Randeep Hooda. Her portrayal of a lonely teenage girl who develops stockholm syndrome after being abducted was acclaimed by the critics.[20] Rachit Gupta of Filmfare mentioned that "at 20, it's surprising how Alia has got so many deft nuances right.
